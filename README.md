# triangle_inequality_theorem

The program asks for three integers from the user, each one being the length of each side of a triangle.
It checks if this triangle can exist with the Triangle Inequality Theorem.
If it can't, it prints an error message and the program ends.
If it can, the program finds the type, the perimeter, and the area of the triangle.
